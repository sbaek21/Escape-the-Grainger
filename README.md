## Game Overview
**Escape the Grainger** is a thrilling third-person, side-scrolling platformer designed to challenge players with its progressively difficult levels and dynamic gameplay. Players control a movable pawn tasked with jumping over obstacles, avoiding enemies, and collecting items to survive and advance. With four main levels plus a tutorial, players must master timing, precision, and strategy to complete the game.

## Gameplay
In **Escape the Grainger**, players navigate through challenging levels, avoiding spikes, fire pits, and other obstacles while collecting coins and health packs to enhance their score and survival. The game increases in difficulty as players advance, with obstacles appearing closer together and requiring sharper reflexes.

Each level features checkpoints to save progress. While hitting an obstacle reduces health, falling off the map results in restarting the level from the beginning. Players must maintain their health to progress; if health is fully depleted, they restart the current level. Collectibles, including coins and health packs, reset only when the player dies, adding a strategic layer to the gameplay.
